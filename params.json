New features are still in development.\r\n\r\n###Main features\r\n\r\n* JSON-RPC 2.0 compatible, exposition of application functionalities. (Batch method call is not still supported).\r\n* Real time data streaming support with built-in publish-subscribe pattern.\r\n* Built-in client session control.\r\n* Asynchronous messaging model.\r\n* Message format (Text in Json-RPC format)\r\n* Websocket full support: RFC6455.\r\n* TLS support (through [websocket++](http://www.zaphoyd.com/websocketpp))\r\n* Ipv6 support (through [websocket++](http://www.zaphoyd.com/websocketpp))\r\n\r\n###Possible applications:\r\n\r\n* Telemetry systems.\r\n* Real time monitoring systems.\r\n* Real time market data streaming.\r\n* Data adquisition and [SCADA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA) applications.\r\n\r\nFor more information and examples please visit the [project site](http://skywarpcpp.wordpress.com).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
